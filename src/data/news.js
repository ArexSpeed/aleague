      q: 'How do you feel right now?',
      a: "Good! Pretty good. Honestly, it’s still not settled, still not really got it, but it feels brilliant. It was big and it was a wonderful experience. The whole ride is a wonderful experience but especially last night. It was very special. When people spoke about it and thought maybe it’s better to win it against City when we play them [next week] on the pitch, but honestly after the 97 points ride last year plus extension with the Champions League, and this season, and all the years before chasing the Champions League spot, I was thinking I want it as early as possible."

      q: "How nice was it that you were all together last night? I’m not sure how much of a part you played in making it happen, but the group all able to enjoy that moment together",
      a: "Look, so many people would have deserved to be part of this last night. So many more people than there were last night. But we had to make decisions. We all had to make decisions and the decision was everybody who is at Melwood in the moment with us every day and got tested twice can be there, no other people. So we did it without families of course, we did it without the wives as well. It was just the team and the staff around, but that was the minimum that we had to do. You couldn’t or I cannot imagine how it would have been had we been all alone at home. Yes, with our families but still kind of alone and not with the players together, how that would have felt. So it was perfect. It was perfectly organised. Nobody had a long time to organise it obviously. We decided to do it after the game against Crystal Palace, we will give it a try. It was big, a big emotional moment. The final whistle was a big moment. "

        q: "Was it a kind of night when you spoke to the players or did you just want to see them celebrating?",
        a: "I think it would have been appropriate to speak but I couldn’t. I just couldn’t. I realised when I started doing the Sky TV interview when the tears came up and then I spoke to Ulla. I had no chance to say a word, I just cried and if I’d have spoken to the players they wouldn’t understand me, so it was not the right moment to do. I have enough opportunities to tell the boys what I think about them and how thankful I am and how much I appreciate their effort they put in, the determination, desire, everything. But they should understand me in that moment and it was not possible last night."

      For the first time the leader is Arkov Diamod, a team which is built on young players from academy and I think everyone enjoys their game. As leader the didn't lost any game, won 11 and draw 4 times what gives 37 points.

        Current champion Victory Tigers are 6 but we have to remember they are always dangerous and unpredictable. Their games are so emotional and gripping to the last second. They lost only 2 games but they draw as many as six.

        The best assistant second season in row is Tim Arkovsky with 8 assists and 8 goals is even the best in the summary classification. The brain of Shamrock is on another level and his quality is a great advantage of his club. 
        In an infamous cards classification the first is Tales Milan who collected as many as 3 red cards which show us how big a mess is inside the worst current team Ronnpolis.

Remember that a football game needs a referee to start. He is a permanent element of the game.In referee you have to understand that there is no easy situation sometimes you have to make a difficult decision. The function of arbitrator develops various human traits, such as quick decision making, people management or coping with work under conditions of stress and time pressure. This is useful not only on the pitch but also in life.

      `,
      a: `Of course. From a player's view you look at football through the prism of the will to win. For referees the most important is that the competition follows strictly defined rules. This teaches discipline. In addition, referee training means that you always maintain a proper physical condition, you have to pass exams and train regularly. Moreover it is easier to stay fit in a group of referees. You can also learn more about training secrets and methods of regeneration. It is a constant exchange of information as well as interesting acquaintances and friendship that can remain for life.

I would like refereeing to still be fun and if I will be good enough I can get a chance to appear on the biggest ares.

He is 19 years old and plays as a central striker but he is also flexible and he can play also on the wings. This will be useful for tactics. The transfer talks are nearing completion and player should start medical tests in a few days. Let us remind you that this is the third transfer to the Bolts teams. After strengthening the defence they want to add quality to attack. It heralds that Diampero wants to join the fight for the championship. "
